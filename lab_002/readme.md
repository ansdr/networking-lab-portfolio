This lab is for trying out DHCP Advanced Techniques like the below -
DHCP Exclusion Ranges: Exclude certain IP addresses from the DHCP pool for those you want to assign statically (like servers or printers), then assign them manually.
DHCP Reservations: Configure DHCP to always assign the same IP address to specific devices based on their MAC addressâ€”helpful for important equipment.
Simulate DHCP Failure: Temporarily disable the DHCP server and manually set static IPs to practice troubleshooting address conflicts and connectivity issues.
